afGuard plugin
==============

This plugin is made from sfGuardPlugin.
It is modified to be compatible for applications using AppFlowerPlugin

In original sfGuardPlugin modules for CRUD operations are auto generated and
we should probably follow the same approach.

What you need to use it.
Your symfony application should have AppFlowerPlugin already installed.
Next you should install afGuardPlugin in your project - you can just copy its
files or create local reopistory from SVN or alter svn:externals property of plugins directory.

As always you should rebuild model and sql, running:
./symfony propel:build-model
./symfony propel:build-sql
./symfony cc

Now you should initiate proper database structure with (thiw will delete all your data:O):
./symfony propel:insert-sql

Make your application secure with apps/frontend/config/security.yml like:
default:
  is_secure: true

Change settings.yml like:
all:
  .settings:
    .enabled_modules: [default, ..., afGuardAuth]
  .actions:
    login_module: afGuardAuth
    login_action: signin


Copy afGuardPlugin/templates/layoutAuth.php to apps/frontend/templates directory.

Make sure that you ProjectConfiguration class implements AppFlowerApplication interface correctly.
For example like that:
   function getAppFlowerUserQuery()
   {
      return new afGuardUserPeer();
   }

Change you apps/frontend/lib/myUser.class.php to extend afGuardSecurityUser and implement AppFlowerSecurityUser


You can also enable more modules like: afGuardUser, afGuardGroup to manage users and groups through AF interface.
all:
  .settings:
    .enabled_modules: [defaul, ..., afGuardAuth, afGuardUser, afGuardGroup]
After this you can access them using url: http://yourapp/#/afGuardUser/list


Finally if you want to use "remember me" functionality change security filer in your apps/frontend/config/filters.yml:
security:
  class: afGuardBasicSecurityFilter
